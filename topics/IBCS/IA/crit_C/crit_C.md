# Criterion C: Development

Criterion C assesses your ability to implement a complex, original solution by demonstrating coding skills, problem-solving techniques, and attention to detail. This criterion requires technical execution and thorough explanations that showcase algorithmic thinking, complexity, and ingenuity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Components of Criterion C

### 1. Implementation of the Solution

Implementation is the process of transforming your design from Criterion B into a functional product. This includes coding each component, structuring it modularly, and ensuring alignment with the design overview. Reference your Record of Tasks (RoT) in Criterion B to ensure each development step matches planned actions.

**Effective Implementation Tips:**
- Follow Your Design: Each feature implemented should correspond to elements from your design documentation.
- Modular Coding: Develop in modules, testing each part to ensure robustness.
- Code Organization: Use clear, structured coding practices with meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes, improving readability and maintainability.

**Examples:**
- For Java projects: Implement class hierarchies, file handling with `RandomAccessFile`, or use `ArrayList` and `HashMap` for efficient data management.
- For Python projects: Implement custom data structures, use libraries like `pandas` for data processing, or integrate recursion for solving complex problems.

### 2. Demonstrating Complexity and Ingenuity

Criterion C requires complexity and ingenuity in your code, involving advanced programming techniques, creative problem-solving, and sophisticated algorithmic thinking. To achieve high marks, demonstrate both advanced techniques and original implementation.

**Complexity**  
Demonstrated by:
- File Manipulation: Reading, writing, and managing data files.
- Advanced Data Structures: Implementing linked lists, binary trees, or multi-dimensional arrays.
- Use of Algorithms: Implementing sorting (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort) or search algorithms.
- Control Structures: Using nested loops, recursive functions, and conditional statements.

**Ingenuity**  
Demonstrated by:
- Original Approach: Implementing unique solutions that showcase creative use of programming constructs.
- Efficient Algorithms: Using recursion or dynamic programming to optimize solutions.
- Code Modularity: Organizing code to fulfill single tasks, enhancing readability and reusability.

**Examples of Techniques:**
- Java: Implement a linked list or tree structure with custom methods for insertion, deletion, and search; use Javaâ€™s `Stream` API for efficient data manipulation.
- Python: Implement advanced libraries like `NumPy` for multi-dimensional arrays, or use `matplotlib` for real-time data visualization.

### 3. Justifying Tools and Techniques

Each tool, technique, and library used in your solution must be justified. This involves explaining why each choice is appropriate and how it enhances the functionality of your solution.

**How to Justify Your Choices:**
- List Techniques: Include around 7 key techniques used, starting from the most complex.
- Explain Appropriateness: Describe why each technique is suited to the problem, referencing specific aspects of the design.
- Annotate Code: Use in-line comments for complex sections, clarifying decision-making and algorithmic steps.

**Example:**
If using recursion, explain that it provides an efficient solution for repetitive breakdowns, such as searching hierarchical data structures.

### 4. Documenting the Development Process

Documentation should provide a detailed account of the development process, showcasing problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

**How to Document Development:**
- Use the Record of Tasks (RoT) from Criterion B: Make entries in the RoT to record each significant implementation step, including challenges and resolutions.
- Screenshots and Code Excerpts: Provide annotated screenshots of code and rendered outputs.
- Algorithmic Thinking: Clearly describe the algorithmic process for each key feature, supported by screenshots, pseudocode, or flowcharts.

### 5. Using a Test Plan

Testing should be conducted based on the Test Plan created in Criterion A. As you develop, test each component to ensure it meets the established success criteria, documenting test outcomes in your Test Plan.

Ensure every success criterion has a corresponding test in the Test Plan from Criterion A.

### 6. Evidence of Algorithmic Thinking

Algorithmic thinking is the process of breaking down problems into manageable steps. Explicitly provide evidence of this thought process, particularly in complex areas.

**How to Provide Evidence:**
- Explain Choice of Algorithms: Discuss why specific algorithms were selected, referencing efficiency and suitability.
- Big O Notation: Where applicable, explain algorithm efficiency using Big O notation.
- Pseudocode and Flowcharts: Use pseudocode to illustrate logic, especially for complex algorithms like recursion or sorting.

### 7. Ensuring Extensibility and Reusability

Good code should be extensible (easily modifiable for future use) and reusable (flexible for integration with other systems).

**How to Show Extensibility and Reusability:**
- OOP Principles: Use inheritance and polymorphism in Java or Python to create classes that can be extended.
- Comments for Reusability: Include in-line comments that clarify how certain functions or classes can be reused or extended.

**Examples:**
- Java: Create a base class for a set of related objects, with methods that subclasses can override.
- Python: Use modular code with functions that can be imported and reused.

### 8. Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- Superficial Descriptions: Avoid merely narrating what you did; explain **why** each decision was made and **how** it contributes to the product.
- Lack of Evidence for Complexity: Support each complex aspect with detailed explanations and code excerpts. For instance, if using recursion, explain its purpose and how itâ€™s implemented.
- Omitting Justification for Techniques: Each tool, technique, or library should have a justification. If using Java Swing for GUI, explain its suitability for interactive user interfaces.

### Assessment Guide for Complexity and Ingenuity

The table below details how complexity and ingenuity scores are balanced. Aim to demonstrate high levels in both for the maximum score.

| High           | Moderate      | 7-10           |
| High           | Low           | 5-8            |
| Moderate       | High          | 7-10           |
| Moderate       | Moderate      | 5-8            |
| Moderate       | Low           | 3-6            |
| Low            | High          | 5-8            |
| Low            | Moderate      | 3-6            |
| Low            | Low           | 1-4            |
